ENGLISH TRANSLATION: "You Didn't Understand the Unknown Reasons Behind the Success Story of Xiaoshan Door-to-Son-in-Law"

This morning I mocked some economist for sending his son to Japan to marry into a wealthy family, foolishly hoping to get a share of the Japanese tycoon's fortune.

Some readers asked, then how do you explain the past success stories of Xiaoshan door-to-son-in-law? After all, some people have succeeded.

Let me tell you, there are two reasons behind this.

The first reason is timing.

Those who truly achieved social mobility through marrying into Xiaoshan families mostly happened one or two decades ago.

At that time, Xiaoshan bosses had already made money, but never imagined they would become so big later, reaching world-class levels.

This is like 20 years ago when a second-tier university graduate could join a big tech company and become a senior executive. Today, unless you're from the top 5 domestic universities or Ivy League schools abroad, you can't even pass the HR screening.

Because back then, big tech companies only knew they had a future, but never imagined their future would become world-class.

In other words, the old Xiaoshan door-to-son-in-law didn't earn money from marrying in, but from timing - they invested in potential stocks.

They married into families when their father-in-law's company was still medium-sized, growing together with them.

If you look at Xiaoshan's requirements for recruiting door-to-son-in-law today, they are extremely harsh.

Because the other party has realized they're very wealthy, they've become very picky - requiring you to be a top student from prestigious schools, requiring you to pass extremely competitive exams, with requirements for appearance and physique, and they're guarding against you from start to finish. You can't get the money at all.

You still want to eat their "only-child" family fortune? They only want to keep the child and remove the father.

The second reason is that they were nouveau riche.

The old Xiaoshan fathers-in-law were all first-generation rich.

What's the characteristic of first-generation rich? Their income all comes from incremental wealth.

Money you earn from outside, you might be willing to share with your son-in-law - note, it's only possible.

But let's think about what those old money families in Japan are?

They're all Nth-generation rich, many have been around for over ten or eight generations.

What's old money? The eldest daughter in Downton Abbey explained it clearly in one sentence.

"Since birth, we have never earned incremental wealth, we only focus on stock wealth."

In other words, this family has been fighting over inheritance for generations, they're hereditary at this.

A family with blood relations can fight over stock wealth to the point of bloodshed, and you, an outsider, still want to get a share?

Many of us are very naive. This isn't about personality, but about not having experienced the alienation of capital on people.

Most people asking about this topic, including those economists who send their sons to Japan hoping for marriage into wealth, investment is not their main source of income.

So you haven't experienced the alienation of capital on your personality.

Let me ask you to imagine a scenario.

Suppose you don't have a job, most of your expenses and income come from investments, what kind of mentality would you have?

You would value money extremely heavily, because it's your lifeline.

There's a joke online about labor income not keeping up with capital income, causing many people to misunderstand.

They think the income comes from capital itself.

Let me ask you, what is capital?

Money is capital. The deposits in your bank are capital.

Tell me, what's the return rate on your spare money? Or is it actually negative returns?

Don't say it's because you don't have enough money. NO, it's because you're not capable.

If you can't even preserve and increase value with hundreds of thousands or millions, giving you more zeros will only make you lose faster.

At any time, the less money you have, the higher the return rate - this is an iron law.

I've been in international markets for sixteen years, I've personally watched my return rate decline irreversibly.

Because the smaller the capital, the easier it is to micro-manage, your personal ability can more easily add value to each of your soldiers, each of your dollars.

As capital grows, you become more powerless, returns become increasingly mediocre.

This is why throughout history, there have been very few commanders who could command large armies. This is why Buffett is rare.

His greatness isn't in how much return he had with small capital, but in that he could actually command such a large capital army.

So there's never been a saying that capital outperforms labor.

If the value of deposits is 2 points, then the value of capital is 2 points.

All other points come from people, from the person commanding the capital, who gives it value.

So a person who purely makes a living by commanding capital will inevitably fall into a track of increasingly sophisticated calculation. This process is called the alienation of capital on people.

This is like war - if you want to become a famous general, you will inevitably be haunted by inner demons; if you want to become increasingly skilled at playing with money, you will inevitably be alienated.

Just like farmers make a living by farming, workers by tightening screws, and oil sellers by skilled hands.

Those who professionally play with money make a living by calculating people's hearts while wrapped in fur coats by the fire. The more you calculate, the more skilled you become at calculation, the more trapped you become in calculation.

This is the life of old money, the life of rentiers. You have no more increments, you no longer create wealth, you don't bring any new things to this world.

What you do is nothing more than sucking blood on those new money who create incremental wealth.

So you say you want to marry into old money, want to eat old money's "only-child" family fortune, what is this?

Isn't this saying you want to suck the blood of those vampires?

Heh.

The path of this game is very simple.

People will ultimately be troubled for life by what they couldn't obtain in their youth.

They use this vulnerability in human nature to give you an unreasonable valuation.

For example, that Beijing guy whose family previously ran a restaurant, later even his mother had to come out to do live streaming.

Why did he marry a has-been star from Taiwan back then?

Because of the filter.

Taiwan became wealthy earlier than mainland China, planting a feeling in his youth that "they're all rich," so when he grew up, he would rush to ingratiate himself.

Actually, the other party had long since declined, had no money in their pockets. You exchanged 100 for their 50.

Similarly, that has-been star from Taiwan, does she not have filters?

She also has them.

She also admires South Korea, because compared to Taiwan, South Korea became wealthy earlier.

So she took the money earned by the Beijing guy's mother from live streaming to support the South Korean bald guy, to buy million-dollar mattresses.

Do you see this path of transmission?

The Beijing guy exchanged 100 for the Taiwanese has-been star's 50, the Taiwanese has-been star exchanged 100 for the South Korean bald guy's 50.

So do you understand the expectation management route of eating soft rice?

Soft rice always needs to be eaten hard to be eaten. The best hunters all disguise themselves as prey.

Only old money with empty shells can eat soft rice, can eat new money's "only-child" family fortune.

Just like the Jia Mansion could eat Lin Daiyu's "only-child" family fortune, because Lin Ruhai thought the Jia Mansion was still glorious.

The Jia Mansion could eat Xue Baochai's "only-child" family fortune, because Aunt Xue thought the Jia Mansion was still reliable.

Sun Shao'ou as a nouveau riche, wanting to eat the Jia Mansion's "only-child" family fortune, is it possible?

Impossible.

Sun Shao'ou gave 5000 taels of silver to Jia She, asking him to help with advancement. When the matter wasn't accomplished and the silver couldn't be returned, Sun Shao'ou came up with a plan - thinking that by marrying Jia She's daughter and becoming a cheap son-in-law, he could eat the "only-child" family fortune.

What was the result?

The result was that old money like Jia She didn't care about his daughter at all. Sun Shao'ou deliberately abused Yingchun, making her return to her parents' home crying, thinking that since he had the Jia Mansion's hostage, they would have to compromise.

Then what? Then there was no then.

Jia She simply didn't care. When Yingchun cried to Lady Wang, Jia Zheng and his wife didn't get involved in this matter either.

You still want to scheme against the Jia Mansion, but Jia She, this father-in-law, is still scheming against you.

Jia She and his wife thought Sun Shao'ou was physically strong and too eager to advance, with a thin family line. They thought that by marrying their daughter to him, they could control this son-in-law.

Do you understand? It's full of calculation.

Because their family is professionally eating stock wealth. As Jia Lian said to Wang Xifeng, they spend all day thinking about where to make a fortune of one or two million taels by eating someone's "only-child" family fortune.

Otherwise, what do you think the Jia Mansion relies on to sustain itself?

I systematically talked about expectation management the day before yesterday, telling you that when the whole society's incremental income slows down, it has indeed entered an era of stock game.

But victory in stock games doesn't rely on fantasy novel-like delusions, not that you can get a share of the cake just by opening your mouth, especially not expecting to get it from old money.

They are all experts who have played the expectation management game for generations.

When it comes to creating wealth, they're not as good as you. When it comes to dividing wealth, they're professionals.

When it comes to creating increments, they're not as good as you. When it comes to distributing stock, they're professionals.

Because you play the value game, while they play the valuation game.

You honestly say what you created, while they use the vulnerabilities in human nature to seize your wealth.

This method is what we talked about the day before yesterday - expectation management.

For most people, your current top priority is to make your returns worthy of your efforts.

This is the purpose of your learning expectation management.
