ENGLISH TRANSLATION: "The Reality of Wealth Devouring Scheme for Door-to-Son-in-Law" (Short Video Script)

You want to marry in and eat their "only-child" family fortune, but they're thinking of keeping the child and removing the father. Brother, real door-to-son-in-law isn't played the way you imagine. Many families you think have great businesses and wealth - their sons are standard second-generation, but let me tell you, with economic cycles changing, who knows how many big holes there are in the boy's family business, they're keeping it quiet, and then looking for wives for their sons.

Let me tell you a true story that happened to a friend. Their family runs a pharmaceutical factory, they're an only daughter, their family business is actually quite complicated, but the actual situation is much better than the boy's family. Then the parents on both sides arranged it, the two got married. Outsiders see this as what? This is called family alliance. What happened later? The boy's family business had a Waterloo, the boy's father owed a pile of debts, relying on the girl's family to transfuse blood to maintain operations, relying on the girl's family to get by. Brother, this is called real door-to-son-in-law.

Before marriage, through calculation, through managing the girl's family's expectations, they made the girl think the boy's family was still very wealthy and reliable. The real big holes were all kept quiet, waiting for you to get married and have children, waiting for the rice to be cooked, and then launching the merger. Bit by bit infiltration, bite by bite devouring, step by step, this is the professional posture of eating the girl's family's "only-child" family fortune.

Have you read Dream of the Red Chamber? Brother, how did the Jia Mansion eat Lin Daiyu's "only-child" family fortune? That's because Lin Daiyu's father Lin Ruhai thought the Jia Mansion was still glorious. How did the Jia Mansion eat Xue Baochai's "only-child" family fortune? That's because Xue Baochai's aunt thought the Jia Mansion was still reliable. What was the final result? So what do you think the Jia Mansion relied on to sustain their daily life and survive? They relied on this professional way of eating "only-child" family fortunes.

So brother, let me tell you, real door-to-son-in-law is played this way. Don't believe TV dramas. If you think about door-to-son-in-law all day like in TV dramas, you want to marry in and eat their "only-child" family fortune, they're thinking of keeping the child and removing the father. If you have a son, and if your son takes your father-in-law's surname, they might pass the family business to your son, that's possible, that's blood relation and natural, but for you to inherit, is that possible? Give up the fantasy, self-improvement, okay brother!
