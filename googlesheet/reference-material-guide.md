# Reference Material System Guide

## Overview
The Reference Material system allows you to upload your own successful scripts, techniques, and examples to guide AI script generation. Unlike rigid categorization systems, this approach lets you explain in natural language how each reference should be used.

## How It Works

### 1. Upload Reference Materials
- Click **"ðŸ“¤ Upload Reference Material"** in the menu
- Fill in:
  - **Title**: A memorable name for your reference
  - **Content**: The actual script/technique/example
  - **Purpose**: Explain why you're adding this and how it should be used
  - **Usage Notes**: Optional additional guidance

### 2. Natural Language Instructions
Instead of complex categories, you simply explain the purpose in your own words:

**Example 1 - Successful Script:**
```
Title: "My viral Xiaoshan script"
Purpose: "This got 285K views. I want new scripts to have similar pacing and emotional beats but different content"
```

**Example 2 - Hook Patterns:**
```
Title: "Effective opening hooks"
Purpose: "These openings always grab attention. Use similar patterns but adapt to the new topic"
```

**Example 3 - Writing Style:**
```
Title: "My storytelling style"
Purpose: "This is how I like to structure stories. Follow this flow but with the new article's content"
```

### 3. Transparent Usage
When generating scripts:
- Select which reference materials to use
- The AI sees your exact purpose descriptions
- Results show which references influenced the output

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: No rigid categories to learn
2. **Natural**: Describe intent in your own words
3. **Transparent**: See exactly what instructions the AI receives
4. **Powerful**: Leverages the AI's understanding capabilities

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific in Purpose**: Clearly explain HOW the reference should influence new scripts
2. **Quality Over Quantity**: A few well-explained references are better than many vague ones
3. **Update Based on Results**: If a reference isn't working as expected, update its purpose description
4. **Mix and Match**: Use multiple references together for complex requirements

## Example Workflow

1. Upload a successful script with purpose: "This emotional story format got high engagement, use similar emotional progression"
2. Upload hook examples with purpose: "Start scripts with these types of attention-grabbing openings"
3. When generating, select both references
4. The AI will create scripts with emotional progression AND strong hooks

## The Philosophy

This system follows the "æ´—ç¨¿äºŒåˆ›" (reworked secondary creation) approach - using references as creative guides rather than content to copy. The AI understands your intent through your natural language descriptions and applies the references intelligently.
