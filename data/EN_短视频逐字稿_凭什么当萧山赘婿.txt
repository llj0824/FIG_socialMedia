ENGLISH TRANSLATION: "Why Become a Xiaoshan Door-to-Son-in-Law" (Short Video Script)

Want to become a door-to-son-in-law in Xiaoshan? Brother, don't even think about it, don't have that dream. Let me tell you the underlying logic.

Those who truly achieved social mobility through marrying into Xiaoshan families - those who became door-to-son-in-law and successfully climbed the social ladder - they're not from your generation at all.

The real Xiaoshan door-to-son-in-law were born between 1975-1985.

When this generation was in their 20s, around the year 2000, that's when they married into Xiaoshan families. These are the real Xiaoshan door-to-son-in-law.

Their fathers-in-law were entrepreneurs from the 1940s-1950s generation - basically the earliest township entrepreneurs after China's reform and opening up.

Let me give you some examples: what is now Wanxiang Group was then called Ningwei Commune Agricultural Machinery Factory; what is now Hangmin Group was then called Hangmin Dyeing Factory; what is now Hengyi Group was then called Xiaoshan Commune Knitting Factory; and back then there were Qianjiang Beer Factory, Xiaoshan Lace Factory, etc. These were all enterprises started by the first-generation rich in Xiaoshan, and there were many more companies that weren't so famous but made quiet fortunes.

Twenty years ago, around the year 2000, the first-generation rich grandfathers had already made money, many had several children, and they recruited door-to-son-in-law for their daughters. The door-to-son-in-law directly participated in family business operations. The key point here is that first-generation rich generally have a characteristic - their money was all earned by themselves from scratch outside, this is called incremental income. So first-generation rich naturally believe that loving to strive will win, self-improvement. So these first-generation rich have a more open-minded attitude toward wealth - they'll think having no money is no problem, if you have no money you strive outward, earn outward.

You'll find that the more capable people are at making money, the less they value money itself, the more they value the ability to make money, so they're more likely to be willing to distribute wealth to their son-in-law. When those door-to-son-in-law married into Xiaoshan families in 2000, their fathers-in-law's enterprises were already very large and wealthy, but none of them expected that after China joined the WTO in 2001, global orders would flood in massively, and development would explode.

The profits of the father-in-law's family enterprises basically increased hundreds of times, even thousands of times in many cases, and their family businesses grew all the way to world-class levels. These door-to-son-in-law married in when neither they nor their fathers-in-law expected such huge development later. These are the real door-to-son-in-law - they married in first, then ate the big dividends of the era, they made friends with time.

Brother, you don't understand history, don't understand economics, don't understand business, you have no concept of these things. Now you want to marry into Xiaoshan, who are the people controlling wealth in Xiaoshan now? They're the door-to-son-in-law from that generation, they're that generation of people, they're the children of the first-generation rich. These people are now controlling the wealth. The ones now calling for door-to-son-in-law are actually these people, these people are not simple.

You want to marry into their family, who are they? They're no longer first-generation rich, they're standard second-generation rich. From the day they were born, they belong to the rentier class. From the day they were born, they're fighting over property with brothers and sisters, their eyes are all on stock wealth.

I have a friend like this around me. His father has five children, he's a post-90s generation, he's the youngest child of his father, his father is now over 70 years old, his father's business is very large. Guess what his brothers and sisters are doing now? This friend told me that his older brothers and sisters are trying every possible way to divide his father's property. He wants to be soft-hearted and not fight, but his other brothers and sisters won't be polite to him.

This is the situation. Their wealth itself comes from scheming, from fighting, from divided inheritance. Put yourself in their shoes and think. If you had no job and all your money came from what the previous generation left you, and you used this money to invest and make more money, what would your mentality be? You would value money extremely heavily, because this money is your lifeline. If this money is gone, your life is gone.

They're professionals at playing with money. When it comes to creating wealth, they're not as good as you. When it comes to dividing wealth, they're professionals. When it comes to creating increments, they're not as good as you. When it comes to distributing stock, they're professionals. They make a living by calculating people's hearts, by calculating their own people, by guarding against being calculated by others all day long. Even their own family with blood relations will fight to the death. You're an outsider, you want to marry into their family, you want to get a share, do you think this is possible? Brother.
